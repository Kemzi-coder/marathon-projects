# JavaScript marathon projects

This is a compilation of projects from a JavaScript marathon I participated in in 2019. After participating in the marathon, I realized how easy it is to make beautiful things with JavaScript and discovered new horizons. Each project is unique and focuses on different aspects of the language.

## Warning

The project code is not up to date and does not reflect my skills.
